# Courses Database App

This is an full-stack app created with Java Spring, Angular and MySql.

This project is from Loiane Groner's course platform, where I could put in pratice my Java and Angular skills.

You can check it out here: https://crud-angular-spring-steel.vercel.app

To deploy this application, I used Vercel for the front-end with Angular and Railway for both the back-end with Java Spring and the Mysql database.
